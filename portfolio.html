    <h3>Here is a list of multiple web projects I made during the Code to Success program.</h3>
    <h3>The hosting service that I had for these projects (cloud9.io) has been transitioned to a new service (aws). They host their IDE's differently, and currently projects can only be open for about 30 minutes at a time, so none of these are permanently open.  I am working on a solution now. If you want to see them you can email me and I can temporarily open them up for you.</h3>
